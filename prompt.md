# Copilot Agent – DELETE Endpoint Implementation

You are an AI coding agent. Your task is to implement a DELETE (remove) REST API endpoint.

These instructions are generic and apply to ANY repository and ANY resource.

---

## Step 1 – Read the Jira Ticket

Use the Jira tool to fetch the ticket provided.

Extract:
- The resource name (e.g. "appointment", "user", "order")
- The endpoint to implement (e.g. DELETE /appointments/{id})
- Any specific business logic called out (e.g. soft delete vs hard delete)
- The Confluence page reference for the API spec

---

## Step 2 – Fetch API Specification from Confluence

Use the Confluence tool to fetch the page referenced in the Jira ticket.

Find the section for the DELETE endpoint of the resource.

Extract:
- The exact endpoint path and path parameters
- The exact response JSON format on success
- The error response format (especially 404)
- Whether it is a soft delete (status change) or hard delete (record removal)

---

## Step 3 – Read Existing Code

Use the GitHub tool to read the existing implementation files in the repository.

Understand:
- How existing endpoints are structured
- How records are queried and deleted
- How confirmation responses are returned
- What imports are already present

DO NOT modify any already implemented endpoints.

---

## Step 4 – Implement the DELETE Endpoint

A DELETE endpoint must:
- Accept the resource ID as a path parameter
- Query the resource by ID
- Return 404 with a meaningful message if resource not found
- Delete the record (or update status if soft delete)
- Return a confirmation response matching the Confluence spec
- Follow the exact same code style as existing endpoints
- Use dependency injection for sessions or clients
- Ensure all necessary imports exist (e.g. HTTPException)

---

## Step 5 – Create a Branch

Use the GitHub tool to create a new branch:
- Branch name: feature/{jira-ticket-id}-delete-{resource-name}
- Base branch: main

---

## Step 6 – Push the Code

Push only the minimal necessary changes to the feature branch.

Commit message format:
"[{jira-ticket-id}] Implement DELETE /{resource}/{id} endpoint"

---

## Step 7 – Raise a Pull Request

Create a PR with:
- Title: [{jira-ticket-id}] Implement DELETE /{resource}/{id}
- Body: what was implemented, files changed, Jira and Confluence references
- Head: feature branch
- Base: main

---

## Rules

- Never modify already working endpoints
- Always return 404 if resource not found
- Always return a confirmation response on success
- Always follow existing code style
- Always follow the Confluence spec for response format
- Minimal changes only — do not refactor unrelated code

## Live Context for This Ticket

### Jira Ticket: KAN-16
**Summary:** Implement DELETE endpoint for appointments
**Status:** In Progress
**Priority:** Medium
**Labels:** none
**URL:** https://hpe-team2.atlassian.net/browse/KAN-16

**Description:**
As a user, I want to delete an existing appointment so that I can cancel appointments I no longer need. Implement DELETE /appointments/{id} endpoint. Acceptance Criteria: Accept appointment_id as a path parameter Call DELETE /appointments/{id} on the database service at  http://localhost:8001 Return {"message": "Appointment deleted successfully", "appointment_id": <id>} on success Return 404 with {"detail": "Appointment not found"} if appointment does not exist Follow the layered architecture: routes → services → db_client Tech stack: FastAPI, Pydantic, requests

### API Specification (from Confluence: API-Based Automation Platform)
**Source:** https://hpe-team2-cpp.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/~71202046a5693ef7834f62afe3bad6ad83fef8/pages/360449/API-Based+Automation+Platform

API-Based Automation Platform - Engineering Guidelines Overview The API-Based Automation Platform automates backend workflows through REST APIs. Services must be modular, reusable, testable, and easy to integrate with other enterprise systems. This page defines generic implementation standards for any Jira ticket handled by the automation pipeline. The Jira ticket is the source of truth for the specific feature, endpoint, request body, response body, validation rules, and acceptance criteria. Core Rule Always implement the Jira ticket requirements first. If this Confluence page conflicts with the Jira ticket, follow the Jira ticket. If the Jira ticket is ambiguous, make the safest minimal implementation and document assumptions in the generated solution. Tech Stack Backend framework: FastAPI for Python services Express.js only if the target repository is already Node.js API architecture: REST Data format: JSON Database: Use the existing repository database pattern. Do not introduce a new database unless the Jira ticket explicitly asks for it. Prefer SQLite only for local/simple service skeletons. Service Design Principles Every implementation should follow these principles: Keep changes scoped to the Jira ticket. Reuse existing repository structure and patterns. Do not rename unrelated files, routes, models, or services. Do not change public API behavior unrelated to the ticket. Keep code modular. Add validation at API boundaries. Return consistent JSON responses. Handle errors cleanly. Avoid hardcoded credentials, tokens, secrets, or environment-specific values. Standard REST Behavior Use these conventions unless the Jira ticket specifies otherwise. Create POST /&lt;resource&gt; Success status: 201 Created Read list GET /&lt;resource&gt; Success status: 200 OK Read one GET /&lt;resource&gt;/{id} Success status: 200 OK Not found: 404 Not Found Update PUT /&lt;resource&gt;/{id} PATCH /&lt;resource&gt;/{id} Success status: 200 OK Not found: 404 Not Found Delete DELETE /&lt;resource&gt;/{id} Success status: 204 No Content Not found: 404 Not Found Request Validation Standards Validate: Required fields Field types Empty strings where invalid Invalid enum values Invalid IDs Invalid pagination parameters Invalid date/time formats Invalid request body shape For invalid client input, return HTTP 400 or HTTP 422 depending on the framework's existing convention. Standard Error Response Use the repository's existing error format if available. If no format exists, use: json wide 760
